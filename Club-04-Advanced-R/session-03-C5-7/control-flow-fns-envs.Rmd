# Conditional statements

* An `if` statement return a value, so you can assign the results
  * If there is no `else` clause, then when condition is false returns NULL
* Generates an error if condition can't be evaluated as a boolean
  * Vector of booleans only generates a warning, but you can change this behavior
* `ifelse()` is a vectorized version of `if`


* The `switch()` statement allow more than two branches 
  * Also returns NULL if no branches match
  * Allows leaving right side of `=` blank if you have consecutive items with the same value
  * Recommended to only use with string inputs
  * Recommended to throw an error if no branches match
* `dplyr::case_when()` is like a vectorized `switch()`

  
---
# Loops

* Most common is `for` loop
  * Syntax is `for (item in vector) perform_action`
  * Can use `next` to skip to next iteration
  * Can use `break` to exit loop entirely

  
* Note that `seq_along(x)` is safer than `1:lenth(x)` because of the zero case
* Also use `for (i in seq_along(x))` with `x[i]` when `x` is a S3 vector


* There are also `while` and `repeat` loops if you need them

---
# Functions

* Functions have three parts:  formals, body, and environment
  * Primitive functions don't have these parts, and are written in C for performance reasons
* Use `do.call(fn, arg_list)` if you already have arguments
* For multiple fn calls, you call use intermediate variables, nest calls, or use pipe `%>%`

.pull-left[
* R uses *lexical scoping*, except ignores non-functions when looking up names
```{r lexical, echo=TRUE}
g09 <- function(x) x + 100
g10 <- function() {
  g09 <- 10
  g09(g09)
}
g10()
```
]
.pull-right[
* R looks for values when the function is run, not when it was created
```{r dynamic, echo=TRUE}
g12 <- function() x + 1
x <- 15
g12()

x <- 20
g12()
```
]

---
# Functions

* Arguments are *lazily evaluated*
  * Promises contain 3 things:  an expression; an environment; a value, initially blank, cached once computed
* Special `...` (dot-dot-dot) argument allows any number of additional arguments
  * Usually, though not required, the additional arguments are namedsu


* Return values can be implicit or explicit, visible or invisible
* `stop()` exits a function with an error
* `on.exit()` always runs at the end of a function, even if it errors

---
# Functions

* There are four function forms in R:  prefix, infix, replacement, and special


* Prefix functions are the common ones we're used to, like `mean(1:6)`
  * The other three types all have special names which can be called in prefix form


* R has built in infix operators like `+`
* You can define your own with % surrounding the name, e.g. `%my_infix%`


* Replacement functions have a special name `xxxx<-`
  * They look like they modify their arguments in place, but is actually syntactic sugar for return a modified copy


* Special forms also have prefix code identical to the special form.  For example:
```{r special form, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:10) print(i)
`for`(i, 1:10, print(i))
```


---
# Environments

* Environments bind names to values
* An environment is similar to a named list, with four differences:
  * Every name must be unique
  * The names in an environment are not ordered
  * An environment has a parent
  * Environments are not copied when modified -- reference semantics
* Every environment has another environment as its parent, except the empty environment, `R_EmptyEnv`
  * The ancestors of every environment eventually terminate with the empty environment
* `rlang::env_bind()` is one way to create/set a binding in an environment
  * `env_bind_lazy()` creates *delayed bindings*, these are promises, as with function arguments
  * `env_bind_active()` reates *active bindings*, which are re-computed every time they are accessed
  
---
# Kinds of environments

* The *global environment*, sometimes called your "workspace," is where interactive computation takes place
* The *current environment* is the environment where your code is running
  * If you run something in the R console, the current environment starts as the global environment
* The R base package starts as the parent to the global environment
  * Each package you load (e.g. with `library()`) gets inserted as the new parent to the global environment
  * The chain of packages forms the *search path* as in this diagram:
<img src="search-path.png" width="80%" />

---
# Function environments

* When you define a function, it binds the current environment as its *function environment*
  * The function environment is used to search variable names using lexical scoping
```{r function environment, echo=TRUE}
y <- 1
f <- function(x) x + y
fn_env(f)
```
<img src="function-binding.png" width="30%" />

---
# Namespace environments

* When you create a package, it has a special *namespace environment*
  * Every binding in the package environment is also in the namespace environment, so package functions can find each other
  * Its parent is the package's *imports environment* with all the functions used by that package
  * The imports environment's parent is always the base namespace
  * The parent of the base namespace is the global environment
  * Illustrating the `stats` package containing functions `sd()` and `var()` we get this:
<img src="namespace.png" width="70%" />

---
# Execution environments

* Each time a function is called, a new *execution environment* is created to host the execution
  * An execution environment is usually quite temporary, going away once the function has finished execution
  * If you return a function with a binding to that execution environment, it will persist
  * The book has an example of a function factory, `plus()`:


.pull-left[

```{r function, echo=TRUE}
plus <- function(x) {
  function(y) x + y
}

plus_one <- plus(1)
plus_one

```

]

.pull-right[<img src="plus_one.png" width="50%" />]

# Call stack

* The call stack is made up of frames containing the function call history
  * You can view the **c**all **s**tack **t**ree with `lobstr::cst()`
  
#### Key parts of a stack frame
* An expression showing the function call with parameters

* An environment, usually the execution environment of a function
  * One exception is the one for the global frame is the global environment
  * Another exception is if you call `eval()`, you can pass any environment for the frame that is created

* A parent pointer, linking to the caller's stack frame

#### Identifying a function's caller
* Following parent links from an environment will get you its lexical ancestors
* To figure out the caller environment, such as when you run `rlang::caller_env()`, R must use the call stack

---
# Environment miscellany

* `<<-` differs from `<-`
  * It looks to update a variable in a parent environment
  * If it doesn't find one, it will create a variable in the global environment
  
* The author mentions that you can also use environments as an alternative data structure for:
  * Maintaining state inside a package across function calls
  * Using large data, while ensuring copies will never be made
  * As a hashmap

# Questions

1. Why does this code succeed without errors or warnings?  (Ex. 5.3.3 #1)
  ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  x <- numeric()
  out <- vector("list", length(x))
  for (i in 1:length(x)) {
    out[i] <- x[i] ^ 2
  }
  out
  ```

---
# Questions

1. This code makes a list of all functions in the base package. (Ex. 6.2.5 #5b)
How many base functions have no arguments? What’s special about those functions?
  ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  objs <- mget(ls("package:base", all = TRUE), inherits = TRUE)
  funs <- Filter(is.function, objs)`
  ```

2. What does the following function return? (Ex 6.4.5 #3) 
  ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  f <- function(x) {
    f <- function(x) {
      f <- function() {
        x ^ 2
      }
      f() + 1
    }
    f(x) * 2
  }
  f(10)
  ```

---
# Questions

1. Explain the following results:  (Ex. 6.6.1 #1)
  ```{r, echo=TRUE}
  sum(1, 2, 3)
  mean(1, 2, 3)
  
  sum(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)
  mean(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)
  ```

1. Clarify the following list of odd function calls:  (Ex. 6.8.6 #2)
  ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  x <- sample(replace = TRUE, 20, x = c(1:10, NA))
  y <- runif(min = 0, max = 1, 20)
  cor(m = "k", y = y, u = "p", x = x)
  ```

---
# Questions

1. Explain why `e[[1]]` and `e[c("a", "b")]` don’t make sense when `e` is an environment. (Ex. 7.2.7 #4)

2. How is `search_envs()` different from `env_parents(global_env())`?  (Ex. 7.4.5 #1)
